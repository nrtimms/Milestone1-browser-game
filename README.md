## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://nrtimms.github.io/Milestone1-browser-game/>.


## Project Description

In this game, you boat around the map to catch interesting fish, because fishing mini-games make every game better.


## Game Logic

```
  - The player can move a boat around a map of water.
  - Bubbling spots on the map indicate a fishing location.
  - To catch fish, the player will have to hit a button every time an oscillating ball aligns with a target.
  - The game will keep track of how many fish were caught in a row, without a fish escaping.
  - High score will be saved through multiple playthroughs. 
```


### MVP Criteria

- Must be able to move around the map.
- Must be able to alternate between fishing interface and boating around.
- Have at lease five fish to catch.


### Post-MVP Plans

- Add background audio.
- Add more fish to catch.
- Animate boat.
- Create an encyclopedia to track all fish caught.
